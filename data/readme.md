All the data used was from [safegraph](safegraph.com)

Using Safegrah data I filtered to brands of Starbucks and Dunkin' in the state of GA. 

The main dataset I used was [core_poi-geometry-patterns](data\core_poi-geometry-patterns.csv)

I also used the built in R-package [us_boundaries](https://github.com/ropensci/USAboundaries)
